                <br>
                <br>
                Timothy Shaffer; born January 6, 1968, is a Software Engineer who has worked 29 years in the Healthcare Software Industry.  Shaffer most recently worked for Cerner but his
                most notable stints came with Siemens Health Services and Shared Medical Systems (SMS). (They all were actually the same company...Siemens purchased SMS and then sold to Cerner)
                Shaffer worked on software solutions that would allow the different areas and systems within the hospital environment to communicate or interface seamlessly with each other.  He 
                also helped clients in generating files or interface transactions that were used by areas outside of the hospital and most recently helped Good Shepherd Rehabillitation in Allentown 
                save millions of dollars in fines by generating files to report data to the Pennsylvania state agency.

                More in my own words...
                <br>
                <br>
                It's been a long time since I have been in an academic setting.  I graduated from Phoenixville Area High School in 1986 and then from Temple University in 1990 and 
                then right into my first job with Shared Medical Systems.  I have had education opportunities from within the company structure but this is the first time that I have 
                wandered outside into a broader education experience.  I hope to be able to put what I am learning into immediate use while still drawing on my experience to continue my career in 
                software engineering.

                I am married to the woman in the photo, Maureen, and that is an example of how we are together, having a good time at Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville in Universal Studios Orlando, Florida.  
                I have 2 sons, Thomas (26) and Johnathon (23) and 2 step-sons, Connor (22) and Logan (18).  Maureen and I have a Shih Tzu named Isaac that will probably make an appearance or two on 
                my lap during classes.
